Contents of this chapter were taken from \citeother{CDF2014} and simplified for the scope of this thesis. Adjustements were also made with respect to the selected mission sites determined in the previous chapter. Rover modes were identified and then sequenced into high-level Sol mission scenarios. These scenarios served as reference Sols for mission planning. Defining rover modes and reference Sols served as a prerequisite to the following chapter were preliminary power budgets were determined by associating each rover modes with their respective operational duration and power draw.

The chapter is structured as follows: Section \ref{sec:ReferenceSols:RoverModes} provides general definitions of rover modes. The identified rover modes are sequenced into reference Sols in Section \ref{sec:ReferenceSols:ReferenceSols}. The chapter is then summarized in Section \ref{sec:PowerBudget:SummaryAndConclusion}.

\section{Rover Modes}
\label{sec:ReferenceSols:RoverModes}
Not all modes defined in \citeother{CDF2014} were included in this section, however; they may become of interest in future design iterations. The omitted modes are Launch, \ac{EDL}, Deployment, and Safe modes.

It is worth noting that \ac{DTE} Communication operations are encapsulated as their own mode whereas \ac{UHF} Communications are mode activities conducted during Traverse, Science, and Idle modes. Communication operations and their schedules were also taken from \citeother{CDF2014}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Uplink of sol plan either early in the morning (\SI{30}{\minute} \ac{DTE} or \SI{7}{\minute} \ac{UHF}) or during the night (\SI{7}{\minute} \ac{UHF}).
    \item Downlink of high priority data required for planning of the next sol either in the afternoon (\SI{5}{\minute} \ac{DTE}) or during the night (\SI{7}{\minute} \ac{UHF}).
\end{itemize}

The selected rover modes are listed in Table \ref{tab:rover-modes}. Some mode durations were adjusted from those presented in \citeother{CDF2014} in response to power budgeting constraints pertaining to this research.

\section{Reference Sols}
\label{sec:ReferenceSols:ReferenceSols}
Rover modes were sequenced into four reference Sols: Traverse Sol, Science Sol, Battery Recharge Sol, and Hibernation Sol. Mode duration distinctions between mission sites are due to differences in worst-case daylight period lengths mentioned in Section \ref{sec:blabla}.

\subsection{Traverse Sol}
\label{sec:ReferenceSols:TraverseSol}
The Traverse Sol use case is for the rover to reach a pre-planned target destination. The sequence and duration of its modes are shown in Table \ref{tab:mission-scenario-traverse-sol}. A Traverse Sol begins with an Idle mode, mostly dedicated to recharging the rover's batteries. Traverse mode duration distinctions were made with respect to terrain inclination on the basis of propulsion power draw differences which are presented in the following chapter. After a traverse is complete, a short time slot is alotted to science operations so that multiple traverse Sols do not result in lack of scientific return, particularly for long traverse campaigns.

\subsection{Science Sol}
\label{sec:ReferenceSols:ScienceSol}
The Science Sol dedicates a significant portion of a Martian day to conducting science operations to maximize science data collection. The sequence and duration of its modes are shown in Table \ref{tab:mission-scenario-science-sol}.

\subsection{Battery Recharge Sol}
\label{sec:ReferenceSols:BatteryRechargeSol}
The Battery Recharge Sol dedicates an entire Martian day to recharging the rover's batteries. The sequence and duration of its modes are shown in Table \ref{tab:mission-scenario-science-sol}. Only thermal are communication operations are executed during this Sol so that power draws from the battery are minimized in order to prioritize attaining the targetcharge state.

\subsection{Hibernation Sol}
\label{sec:ReferenceSols:HibernationSol}
The Hibernation Sol is the rover's survival mode during a dust storm. During this setting the rover solely draws power from its battery hence only the heater and a timer are on in order to conserve energy.

\section{Summary And Conclusion}
\label{sec:ReferenceSols:SummaryAndConclusion}
The chapter presents selected rover's modes which were used to define reference Sols. Operation durations were established for each mode as a prerequesite to determining power budgets in the following chapter. Some distinctions were made for mode durations, particularly for the Traverse mode which is affected by the daylight time at the mission site location as well as terrain inclination.
