The rover SherpaTT has been deployed in several field experiments where it was put under test within natural and unstructured Mars analogue terrain with respect to general morphology and geology. The rover displayed the ability to cope with natural terrain and to fulffill the task of being an exploration and sampling rover. Currently, the rover is prepared for further autonomous long distance traverses in terrain akin to the Martian environment. However, it features a fueled power generator which cannot be employed in Martian missions thus limiting the system's autonomous mission lifetime to the discharge rate of its two LiPo batteries.

As the rover is meant to approach a higher \ac{TRL}, further development is required on its electrical power subsystem if it is to operate in long term missions. This thesis will explore \ac{SA} configurations for the Martian environment so that future versions of the rover may be designed to navigate the topography of this planetary surface. The constraints imposed from the active suspension system with flexible footprints and varying heights of structural parts of the legs are considered in the design phase.

Initial \ac{SA} requirements will be derived from Mars mission sites that will impose power storage and consumption constraints based on available daily insolations. The \ac{SA} design will be driven by the use the rover's active suspension as a solar tracking mechanism. Alternative use of the wheeled leg system will thus be presented for a use case that goes beyond the obvious scenario of negotatiating complex terrain such as steep slopes. Specifically, the resulting \ac{SA} configuration will demonstrate traverse gains and mass reductions when compared to sizing constraints inherent with a horizontal surface configuration.

%Sites with high geological and exobiological science potential typically require navigating complicated terrains, such as climbing up mountains and volcanoes or going down valleys and craters, which offer an opportunity to analyze solar energy production on inclined surfaces.

%A Lunar mission scenario will also be investigated with particular interest on access to permanently shadowed areas in the southern pole. The mission scenarios will put particular emphasis on including topograpy best tackled by the rover's wheeled leg design, such as climbing up mountains and volcanoes or going down valleys and craters. Sites with high geological and exobiological science potential typically require navigating complicated terrains which offer an opportunity for further power budget analysis that take into account solar irradiance on slopes.
