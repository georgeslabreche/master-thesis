The formulae for insolation calculations were taken from \citemarsenv{Appelbaum1989}, \citemarsenv{Appelbaum1990}, \citemarsenv{Appelbaum1991}, and \citemarsenv{Appelbaum1993}. For the purpose of this thesis, the formulae were implemented into an R package to be used in mission analysis power budgets and energy predictions. Both \citemarsenv{Appelbaum1990} and \citemarsenv{Appelbaum1993} include tables listing pre-calculated insolation values for horizontal and inclined surfacesnat \ac{VL1} and \ac{VL2} locations. These published values were used to validate the R implementation of the insolation formulae. This chapter compares the published and calculated insolation values with each other in order to verify and validate the R package derived from publication.
