Formulae for insolation calculations were taken from [?], [?], and [?] and implemented as an R package developed for this thesis. [?], [?], and [?] include tables of calculated insolation predictions for various input parameters at VL1 and VL2 locations. This chapter compares those predictions with those obtained from the R implementation. This comparative analysis served to verify the implementation of the insolation calculation formalae. The observed deviations are presented in this chapter.
