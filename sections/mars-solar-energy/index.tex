This chapter provides the necessary background on solar radiation in the Martian environment. \refSec{sec:MarsSolarEnergy:SolarRadiation} introduce variables and equations that must will be used when analyzing solar irradiance and insolation on Mars. Power and energy equations are presented in \refSec{sec:MarsSolarEnergy:PhotovoltaicEnergy}. \refSec{sec:MarsSolarEnergy:MissionSites} reviews the selected mission sites and presents their worst case daily insolations. The chapter is summarized and concluded in \refSec{sec:MarsSolarEnergy:SummaryAndConclusion}.

\section{Summary and Conclusion}
\label{sec:MarsSolarEnergy:SummaryAndConclusion}
Understanding the dynamics of the Martian solar radiation environment is a crucial prequisite to  conceptualizing feasible mission scenarios. In this chapter, the potenial solar power and energy outputs were constrainted with mission site selections. Two locations were identified so that rover task planning and \ac{SA} sizing processes may appreciate a richer set of consequences tied to a wider range of environmental variables.
