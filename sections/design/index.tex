This chapter elaborates on the power budget and requirements leading to the proposed solar array design. Reference Sols and their rover modes are defined in \refSec{sec:Design:ReferenceSols} so that mission scenario power budgets may be formalized in \refSec{sec:Design:PowerBudget}. Particular attention is put on analyzing field trial data from which propulsion power draw requirements are extracted. \refSec{sec:Design:RequirementsAndDesignDrivers} consolidates assumptions, requirements, conwtraints, and design drivers that will guide the proposed design of the rover's \ac{PV} system. Solar array sizing and configurations as well as necessary rover body redesign are presented in \refSec{sec:Design:SolarArray}. A rudimentary simulation environment for solar power management is introduced in \refSec{sec:Design:Simulation} as a potential for future work before summarizing and concluding the chapter in \refSec{sec:Design:SummaryAndConclusion}.
