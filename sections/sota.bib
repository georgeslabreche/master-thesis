  abstract  = {Scarab is a demonstration of a lunar rover design to explore polar cold traps for water ice as a potential resource. The envisioned mission scenario lands the rover on the floor of a permanently shadowed crater. The radioisotope powered rover then traverses kilometers in darkness, stopping to drill into the near subsurface and take data. The vehicle design employs a passive kinematic suspension with an active adjustability to lower for drilling and aid in driving. Scarab was designed and built in 2007 and is currently in lab and field testing and further development.},

Four years later, almost to the day, Phoenix was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Station and successfully injected into an interplanetary trajectory on its way to Mars. On May 25, 2008 Phoenix conducted the first successful powered decent on Mars in over 30 years. This paper will highlight some of the key changes since the 2008 IEEE paper of the same name, as well as performance through cruise, landing at the north pole of Mars and some of the preliminary results of the surface mission.11 Phoenix "Follows the water" responding directly to the recently published data from Dr. William Boynton, PI (and Phoenix co-I) of the Mars Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS). GRS data indicate extremely large quantities of water ice (up to 50% by mass) within the upper 50 cm of the northern polar regolith. Phoenix will land within the north polar region at 68.3degN, 124.6degW identified by GRS to harbor near surface water ice and provide in-situ confirmation of this extraordinary find. Our mission has investigated water in all its phases, as well as the history of water as evidenced in the soil and atmospheric characteristics. Access to the critical subsurface region which contains this information was made possible by a third generation robotic arm capable of excavating the expected Martian regolith to a depth of 1m. Phoenix had four primary science objectives: (1) Determine the polar climate and weather, interaction with the surface, and composition of the lower atmosphere around 70deg N for at least 90 sols focusing on water, ice, dust, noble gases, and CO2. Determine the atmospheric characteristics during descent through the atmosphere. (2) Characterize the geomorphology and active processes shaping the northern plains and the physical properties of the near surface regolith focusing on the role of water. (3) Determine the aqueous mineralogy and chemistry as w- ell as the adsorbed gases and organic content of the regolith. Verify the Odyssey discovery of near-surface ice. (4) Characterize the history of water, ice, and the polar climate. Determine the past and present biological potential of the surface and subsurface environments.},

Wheel-terrain interaction plays a critical role in rough-terrain mobility. In this paper, an online estimation method that identifies key terrain parameters using on-board robot sensors is presented. These parameters can be used for traversability prediction or in a traction control algorithm to improve robot mobility and to plan safe action plans for autonomous systems. Terrain parameters are also valuable indicators of planetary surface soil composition. The algorithm relies on a simplified form of classical terramechanics equations and uses a linear-least squares method to compute terrain parameters in real time. Simulation and experimental results show that the terrain estimation algorithm can accurately and efficiently identify key terrain parameters for various soil types.},

These rovers, named Spirit and Opportunity, were each sent on their own scientific mission of exploration. Their objective was to work as robotic geologists. After more than a year the vehicles are still in excellent health, and returning vast amounts of scientific information on the ancient water processes that helped form Mars. Key to the success of the rovers was the development of their advanced mobility system. In this paper the mobility assembly, the mechanical hardware that determines the vehicles mobility capability, is described. The details of the design, test, and performance of the mobility assembly are shown to exceed the mission requirements. The rovers' ability to traverse the Mars terrain with its combination of rocks, craters, soft soils, and hills was verified, and the system design validated.},

Differential kinematics is derived for the individual wheel motions in contact with the terrain. The resulting equations of the individual wheel motions are then combined to form the composite equation for the rover motion. Three types of kinematics, i.e., navigation, actuation, and slip kinematics are identified, and the equations and application of each are discussed. The derivations are specialized to Rocky 7, a highly articulated prototype Mars rover, to illustrate the developed methods. Simulation results are provided for the motion of the Rocky 7 over several terrains, and various motion profiles are provided to explain the behavior of the rover.},

This unified software is expanding a developing infrastructure of common tools for operations, control, and hardware interfacing or system simulation. Using these, validation efforts are underway to quantify the performance of the scenario solutions, and document these for subsequent presentation to the upcoming flight projects.},

  Abstract                 = {The control of a legged locomotion system over uneven terrain requires a new approach to coordination. The system has a high degree of static indeterminacy and, because of the stiffness of the structural and actuation systems, has stability problems if position-velocity control is used. The problem has many similarities to that of grasping and manipulating an object in a multi-fingered hand. The stability problem is removed by controlling actuator force directly, but the necessary computations can be prohibitive. A solution is presented which is moderate in its computational requirements. It is based on an assumption of zero foot interaction forces in the horizontal plane.},

  abstract  = {Recon gurable  mobile  robots  are  versatile  platforms  that
may safely traverse cluttered environments by morphing their physical
geometry. However, planning paths for these robots is challenging due to
their many degrees of freedom. We propose a novel hierarchical variant
of the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) algorithm. Our algorithm assumes a
decomposition of the full state space into multiple sub-spaces, and begins
by rapidly  nding a set of paths through one such sub-space. This set
of solutions is used to generate a biased sampling distribution, which is
then explored to  nd a solution in the full state space. This technique
provides a novel way to incorporate prior knowledge of sub-spaces to ef-
 ciently bias search within the existing FMT* framework. Importantly,
probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality are preserved. Ex-
perimental  results  are  provided  for  a  recon gurable  wheel-on-leg  plat-
form  that  benchmark  the  algorithm  against  state-of-the-art  sampling-
based  planners.  In  minimizing  an  energy  objective  that  combines  the
mechanical  work  required  for  platform  locomotion  with  that  required
for recon guration, the planner produces intuitive behaviors where the
robot dynamically adjusts its footprint, varies its height, and clambers
over obstacles using legged locomotion. These results illustrate the gen-
erality of the planner in exploiting the platform's mechanical ability to
 uidly transition between various physical geometric con gurations, and
wheeled/legged locomotion modes.},

In this paper we propose a modular Cable Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR) that is deployed by a rover, which can take advantage of its large workspace for tasks as inspection or light manipulation. While the general deployment procedure is described, focus is given on the CDPR; a model for the pseudostatics of the robot is formulated, as well as an analysis on its modules stability. The workspace is then characterized using appropriate metrics. Results show that a 1 Kg payload for the end-effector is effectively feasible with substantial margin for an equilateral triangular workspace of 10 m side. Finally, several possible practical applications are illustrated. },

  abstract  = {This article addresses the issue of enhancing mobility of actively actuated vehicles by the use of optimal force distribution, and by actively controlling the location of the center of mass of the vehicle body. Force distribution in actively actuated vehicles is an underspecified problem, and optimal force distribution leads to improved contact conditions. Actively actuated vehicles also possess the ability to vary their configuration. This capability can be used to locate the center of mass of the system to further enhance mobility by providing sufficient traction, and ensuring vehicle stability, during difficult vehicle maneuvers. In this work, the general idea of control of the location of the center of mass, followed by optimal force distribution, is addressed first. This is followed by an application of these ideas to Gofor, a simple actively actuated wheeled micro-rover system, that has been designed and fabricated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An algorithm to achieve desired traction and stability has been developed. Simulation studies were performed to investigate negotiation of a vertical surface. It was found that one set of wheels readily climbed the vertical surface with the use of active mass and force distribution. This is a significant improvement over traditional wheeled vehicle systems. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

	We first introduce five terrestrial and aquatic gaits. A duty factor

	proposed robot eQuad can walk with a unique gait by eliminating the
	swing phase of the legs, and it has a large stable margin because

	ePaddle mechanism has the potential to achieve both legged and wheeled
	locomotion with the aid of a simple controller. A decoupled controller

  abstract  = {As part of the Human-Robot Systems project funded by NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has developed a vehicle called ATHLETE: the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer. Each vehicle is based on six wheels at the ends of six multi-degree-of-freedom limbs. Because each limb has enough degrees of freedom for use as a general-purpose leg, the wheels can be locked and used as feet to walk out of excessively soft or other extreme terrain. Since the vehicle has this alternative mode of traversing through or at least out of extreme terrain, the wheels and wheel actuators can be sized for nominal terrain. There are substantial mass savings in the wheel and wheel actuators associated with designing for nominal instead of extreme terrain. These mass savings are comparable-to or larger-than the extra mass associated with the articulated limbs. As a result, the entire mobility system, including wheels and limbs, can be about 25% lighter than a conventional mobility chassis. A side benefit of this approach is that each limb has sufficient degrees-of-freedom to use as a general-purpose manipulator (hence the name "limb" instead of "leg"). Our prototype ATHLETE vehicles have quick-disconnect tool adapters on the limbs that allow tools to be drawn out of a "tool belt" and maneuvered by the limb. A power-take-off from the wheel actuates the tools, so that they can take advantage of the 1+ horsepower motor in each wheel to enable drilling, gripping or other power-tool functions. This paper describes the applicability of the ATHLETE concept to exploration of the moon, Mars and Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs). Recently, the focus of human exploration beyond LEO has been on NEAs. One scenario for exploration of a NEA has been likened to a submarine exploring a wrecked ship - humans would sit in a "bubble" and approach the asteroid for up-close examination and robotic manipulation. What is important is to ensure that the bubble doesn't collide with the asteroid surface, nor f- oat away. Multiple limbs, such as available on ATHLETE, allow for precise positioning and anchoring so as to enable the human bubble to maximize its exploration potential. A microgravity testbed has been constructed in the ATHLETE lab, with six computer-controlled winches able to lift ATHLETE and payloads so as to simulate the motion of the system in the vicinity of a NEA. Accurate 6-axis force-torque sensors will measure the applied forces and moments wherever the vehicle touches a simulated asteroid surface. These measured forces can be used to compute the resultant motion of the vehicle in the microgravity environment, and the winches then move the vehicle along the computed trajectory. Preliminary test results from this system are described.},

In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

  abstract = {In late 2010, the \{DLR\} Space Administration invited the German industry to submit a proposal for a study about a Mobile Payload Element (MPE), which could be a German national contribution to the \{ESA\} Lunar Lander Mission. Several spots in the south polar region of the moon come into consideration as landing site for this mission. All possible spots provide sustained periods of solar illumination, interrupted by darkness periods of several 10 h. The \{MPE\} is outlined to be a small, autonomous, innovative vehicle in the 10 kg class for scouting and sampling the environment in the vicinity of the lunar landing site. The novel capabilities of the \{MPE\} will be to acquire samples of lunar regolith from surface, subsurface as well as shadowed locations, define their geological context and bring them back to the lander. This will enable access to samples that are not contaminated by the lander descent propulsion system plumes to increase the chances of detecting any indigenous lunar volatiles contained within the samples. Kayser-Threde, as prime industrial contractor for Phase 0/A, has assembled for this study a team of German partners with relevant industrial and institutional competence in space robotics and lunar science. The primary scientific objective of the \{MPE\} is to acquire clearly documented samples and to bring them to the lander for analysis with the onboard Lunar Dust Analysis Package (L-DAP) and Lunar Volatile Resources Analysis Package (L-VRAP). Due to the unstable nature of volatiles, which are of particular scientific interest, the \{MPE\} design needs to provide a safe storage and transportation of the samples to the lander. The proposed \{MPE\} rover concept has a four-wheeled chassis configuration with active suspension, being a compromise between innovation and mass efficiency. The suspension chosen allows a compact stowage of the \{MPE\} on the lander as well as precise alignment of the solar generators and instruments. Since therefore no further complex mechanics are necessary, the active suspension significantly contributes to the lightweight \{MPE\} design. The thermal control system enables the \{MPE\} to operate in shaded areas for about 2 h and hibernate darkness periods of about 14 h. Increasing the hibernation capability requires additional battery capacity and thus increases the \{MPE\} mass. As operational modes teleoperations from earth and autonomous navigation are foreseen. The \{MPE\} payload includes navigation cameras, a close-up imager and a mole as sampling device. The \{MPE\} phase 0/A study finished in early 2012. This article describes the resulting \{MPE\} rover concept with focus on its scientific benefit for the Lunar Lander Mission. },

  abstract = {Future robotic vehicles will perform challenging tasks in rough terrain, such as planetary exploration and military missions. Rovers with actively articulated suspensions can improve rough-terrain mobility by repositioning their center of mass. This paper presents a method to control actively articulated suspensions to enhance rover tipover stability. A stability metric is defined using a quasi-static model, and optimized on-line. The method relies on estimation of wheel-terrain contact angles. An algorithm for estimating wheel-terrain contact angles from simple on-board sensors is developed. Simulation and experimental results are presented for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Sample Return Rover that show the control method yields substantially improved stability in rough-terrain.},

  abstract  = {Many algorithms related to localization need good pose prediction in order to produce accurate results. This is especially the case for data association algorithms, where false feature matches can lead to the localization system failure. In rough terrain, the field of view can vary significantly between two feature extraction steps, so a good position prediction is necessary to robustly track features. This paper presents a method for combining dead reckoning sensor information in order to provide an initial estimate of the six degrees of freedom of a rough terrain rover. An inertial navigation system (INS) and the wheel encoders are used as sensory inputs. The sensor fusion scheme is based on an extended information filter (EIF) and is extensible to any kind and number of sensors. In order to test the system, the rover has been driven on different kind of obstacles while computing both pure 3D-odometric and fused INS/3D-odometry trajectories. The results show that the use of the INS significantly improves the pose prediction.},

  abstract    = {This abstract presents a perform study on SOLERO, a new
                 and innovative rover concept for regional mobility on
                 planetary surfaces. A rover is the most suited element to
                 bring scientific instrument to a specific site in order
                 to examine geology, mineralogy or exobiology on
                 extraterrestrial planets. In contrast with the Mars
                 Pathfinder mission, the actual need increases in terms of
                 range and duration. These aspects lead to redesign many
                 aspect of the past rovers, in particular the development
                 of most suitable all terrain performances, autonomous
                 navigation and a new power management concept. In this
                 paper we'll focus on the locomotion and the energy
                 utilization without contribution of batteries. To
                 validate the SOLERO possibilities in these domains and
                 its use for future planetary exploration missions,
                 modelization, testing and Mars like mission simulation
                 have been done. Due to extreme temperatures the use of
                 batteries is a critical point and becomes too expensive
                 in term of size and mass for long-time missions. In this
                 case, a locomotion concept reducing power consumption
                 with exclusive use of on board power generation has to be
                 investigated. The SOLERO mechanical structure is an
                 optimization of the Shrimp rover developed at EPFL. It
                 has one wheel mounted on a fork in the front, one wheel
                 in the rear and two bogies on each side. The parallel
                 architecture of the bogies and the spring suspended fork
                 provides a high ground clearance while keeping all its 6
                 motorized wheels in ground contact. This ensures
                 excellent climbing capabilities over obstacles higher
                 that the wheel diameter. Moreover, this original
                 combination of wheeled locomotion and passive adaptation
                 to help to reduce power consumption compared to active
                 design such as legged rovers, without sensible reduction
                 of climbing abilities. To remove the problems linked with
                 energy storage, not only power reduction is important,
                 but also the power management. SOLERO uses exclusively
                 solar cells to generate the electrical power, because
                 it's currently the most adapted solution for local energy
                 generation on a rover. However the use of solar power
                 only, have several constraints linked with the incoming
                 solar radiation (insolation). To determine SOLERO's power
                 budget and performances, a Mars insolation and
                 environment model has been chosen as reference. The
                 integrated solar power generation restricts the operation
                 time and power to specific daytime. The electrical power
                 provided by a solar panel of 0.3m2 is over 14W during the
                 four hours around noon, this is sufficient for
                 locomotion. The 1kg scientific payload needs less that 8W
                 power and can be used during a maximal time of height
                 hours during daylight. However, the limited power storage
                 capacities and the reduction of power consumption for
                 locomotion allowed this rover to be small, light and
                 operational during more that 100 sols (Martian days). The
                 total mass is only 10kg and its locomotion performance,
                 in comparison with actual rovers, leads SOLERO to become
                 the perfect candidate for long range mission on near-sun
                 planets},

  abstract = {Abstract This research addresses the problem of achieving fault-tolerant cooperation within small- to medium-sized teams of heterogeneous mobile robots. We describe a novel behavior-based, fully distributed architecture, called ALLIANCE, that utilizes adaptive action selection to achieve fault tolerant cooperative control in robot missions involving loosely coupled tasks. The robots in this architecture possess a variety of high-level functions that they can perform during a mission, and must at all times select an appropriate action based on the requirements of the mission, the activities of other robots, the current environmental conditions, and their own internal states. Since such cooperative teams often work in dynamic and unpredictable environments, the software architecture allows the team members to respond robustly and reliably to unexpected environmental changes and modifications in the robot team that may occur due to mechanical failure, the learning of new skills, or the addition or removal of robots from the team by human intervention. After presenting ALLIANCE, we describe in detail our experimental results of an implementation of this architecture on a team of physical mobile robots performing a cooperative box pushing demonstration. These experiments illustrate the ability of ALLIANCE to achieve adaptive, fault-tolerant cooperative control amidst dynamic changes in the capabilities of the robot team.},

  abstract = {The productivity of greenhouses highly depends on the environmental conditions of crops, such as temperature and humidity. The control and monitoring might need large sensor networks, and as a consequence, mobile sensory systems might be a more suitable solution. This paper describes the application of a heterogeneous robot team to monitor environmental variables of greenhouses. The multi-robot system includes both ground and aerial vehicles, looking to provide flexibility and improve performance. The multi-robot sensory system measures the temperature, humidity, luminosity and carbon dioxide concentration in the ground and at different heights. Nevertheless, these measurements can be complemented with other ones (e.g., the concentration of various gases or images of crops) without a considerable effort. Additionally, this work addresses some relevant challenges of multi-robot sensory systems, such as the mission planning and task allocation, the guidance, navigation and control of robots in greenhouses and the coordination among ground and aerial vehicles. This work has an eminently practical approach, and therefore, the system has been extensively tested both in simulations and field experiments.},

Human operators are required to teleoperate the current generation of mobile robots for such applications; however, teleoperation is increasingly difficult as the number of robots is expanded. As the number of robots is increased, each robot may also interfere with one another and eventually decrease mapping performance. As presented here, through careful consideration of robot team coordination and exploration strategy, large numbers of mobile robots can be allocated to accomplish the mapping task more quickly and accurately. We present both the coordination and exploration strategies and present results from experiments in simulation as well as with up to nine mobile platforms. },

Exploring a wide range of terrain types, including plains, cliffs, sand dunes, and lava tubes, requires the development of robotic systems with mobility enhanced beyond that which is currently fielded. These systems include single as well as teams of robots. TRESSA (Teamed Robots for Exploration and Science on Steep Areas) is a closely coupled three-robot team developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that previously demonstrated the ability to drive on soil-covered slopes up to 70 deg. In this paper, we present results from field demonstrations of the TRESSA system in even more challenging terrain: rough rocky slopes of up to 85 deg. In addition, the integration of a robotic arm and instrument suite has allowed TRESSA to demonstrate semi-autonomous science investigation of the cliffs and science sample collection. TRESSA successfully traversed cliffs and collected samples at three Mars analog sites in Svalbard, Norway as part of a recent geological and astrobiological field investigation called AMASE: Arctic Mars Analog Svalbard Expedition under the NASA ASTEP (Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets) program. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The steerer is the only agent that has information about the path, while the pusher exerts the necessary motive force, and rotates to follow changes in the object's orientation. The system is asynchronous, with no explicit communication between the robots. The authors are interested in studying manipulation systems of this type, because they are strongly cooperative; that is, the two robots must act in concert to achieve the goal.

  abstract  = {Mars Sample Return (MSR) is the highest priority planetary science objective as identified in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey. To return a sample to Earth would require the accomplishment of several critical steps in the collection and transfer of the sample from the surface of Mars to the surface of the Earth. While there are many architectures and approaches to returning a sample of Martian surface material to the Earth, the current architecture includes the following series of missions: (1) a sample caching mission which would scientifically select, acquire and cache the sampled material on the surface of Mars, (2) a sample retrieval mission which would collect the sample from the surface and place it into Mars orbit, and (3) a Sample return orbiter which would rendezvous with the sample and return it to Earth. A fourth element of the architecture, the Mars Returned Sample Handling facility (MRSH) would be developed to receive the returned sample and provide for the sample analysis and curation. The Mobile MAV concept is an approach to the sample retrieval and launch element of the architecture. The design concept that was extant during the Decadal Survey studies featured a stationary platform lander, which would land a small fetch rover to retrieve the sample cache (collected by the previous mission), and the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), which would inject the sample cache into Mars orbit. MSL's success in demonstrating a new Entry, Descent, and Landing architecture, which placed the rover directly on the surface in a mobility touchdown configuration, motivates a closer assessment of a MSL class rover which is capable of supporting the MAV and retrieving the cached samples. This architecture eliminates the need for a return trip to a stationary lander, which would be required of a fetch rover in the Decadal Survey mission architecture, significantly reducing the required surface mission duration and traverse requirements.},

There are two types of locomotion for modular robots: a repeating self-reconfiguration and whole-body motion such as walking or crawling. For whole-body locomotion, designing a control method is more difficult than for ordinary robots because a modular robotic system can form various configurations, each of which has many degrees of freedom. This study proposes a unified framework for automatically designing an efficient locomotion controller suitable for any module configuration. The method utilizes neural oscillators (central pattern generators, CPGs), each of which works as a distributed joint controller of each module, and a genetic algorithm to optimize the CPG network. We verified the method by software simulations and hardware experiments, in which our modular robotic system, named M-TRAN II, performed stable and effective locomotion in various configurations.},

Moreover, for a large class of edge-hinged robots the proposed meta-module also performs the scrunch/relax and transfer operations required by any tunneling-based reconfiguration strategy, such as those designed for Crystalline and Telecube robots.

  abstract = {Modular robots consist of many identical units (or atoms) that can attach together and perform local motions. By combining such motions, one can achieve a reconfiguration of the global shape of a robot. The term modular comes from the idea of grouping together a fixed number of atoms into a metamodule, which behaves as a larger individual component. Recently, a fair amount of research has focused on algorithms for universal reconfiguration using Crystalline and Telecube metamodules, which use expanding/contracting cubical atoms. From an algorithmic perspective, this work has achieved some of the best asymptotic reconfiguration times under a variety of different physical models. In this paper we show that these results extend to other types of modular robots, thus establishing improved upper bounds on their reconfiguration times. We describe a generic class of modular robots, and we prove that any robot meeting the generic class requirements can simulate the operation of a Crystalline atom by forming a six-arm structure. Previous reconfiguration bounds thus transfer automatically by substituting the six-arm structures for the Crystalline atoms. We also discuss four prototyped robots that satisfy the generic class requirements: M-TRAN, SuperBot, Molecube, and RoomBot.},

  abstract = { Reconfigurable modular robots have the ability to use different gaits and configurations to perform various tasks. A rolling gait is the fastest currently implemented gait available for traversal over level ground and shows dramatic improvements in efficiency. In this work, we analyze and implement a sensor-based feedback controller to achieve dynamic rolling for a loop robot. The robot senses its position relative to the ground and changes its shape as it rolls. This shape is such that its center of gravity is maintained to be in front of its contact point with the ground, so in effect the robot is continuously falling and thus accelerates forward. Using simulation and experimental results, we show how the desired shape can be varied to achieve higher terminal velocities. The highest velocity achieved in this work is 26 module lengths per second (1.6 m/s) which is believed to be the fastest gait yet implemented for an untethered modular robot. One of the major findings is that more elongated shapes achieve higher terminal velocities than rounder shapes. We demonstrate that this trend holds going up inclines as well as down. We show that rounder shapes have lower specific resistance and are thus more energy efficient. The control scheme is scalable to an arbitrary number of modules, shown here using eight to 14 modules. },

The scope of such tasks could include transportation, exploration, construction, inspection, maintenance,in-situ resource utilization, and support for astronauts. This paper proposes a modular and reconfigurable solution for this challenge by allowing a robot to support multiple modes of locomotion and select the appropriate mode for the task at hand. This solution relies on robots that are made of reconfigurable modules. Each locomotion mode consists of a set of characteristics for the environment type, speed, turning-ability, energy-efficiency, and recoverability from failures. This paper demonstrates a solution using the SuperBot robot that combines advantages from M-TRAN, CONRO, ATRON, and other chain-based and lattice-based robots. At the present, a single real SuperBot module can move, turn, sidewind, maneuver, and travel on batteries up to 500 m on carpet in an office environment. In physics-based simulation, SuperBot modules can perform multimodal locomotions such as snake, caterpillar, insect, spider, rolling track, H-walker, etc. It can move at speeds of up to 1.0 m/s on flat terrain using less than 6 W per module, and climb slopes of no less 40 degrees.},

  abstract  = {Traditional fixed morphology robots are limited to purely functional adaptation and thereby to a limited range of applications. In contrast modular self-reconfigurable robots can dynamically and autonomously change both their function and morphology to meet new demands of changing tasks. Therefore, self-reconfigurable robots have the potential to become highly versatile. This paper documents and discusses the application versatility of self-reconfigurable robots in general and of the ATRON system in particular. We present a range of different self-reconfigurable robots assembled from the ATRON base module. The robot's ability includes locomotion (snake, car, and walker), manipulation of objects (serial manipulator, conveyer belt) and autonomous change of functionality and shape (locomotion configurations, many-module shape-change). We also demonstrate the structure of simple anatomical building blocks (bones, muscles, etc.) which we envision can be assembled into more complex robots of future miniaturized modules.},

The primary features of Axel are its minimal complexity and robustness to the treacherous terrain of sites that are of scientific interest. Using a symmetrical design with three actuators, Axel is capable of operating upside down and right side up, enabling it to descend over crater promontories. With its actuated trailing link, Axel can operate on both flat and sloped terrains. Using a sampling device mounted on the trailing link, Axel can collect and store terrain samples and return to its host platform for detailed scientific sample analysis. We will present our preliminary results that demonstrated Axel's ability to traverse both flat and sloped rocky terrain including 90deg vertical cliffs and collecting soil samples on slopes ranging from 10deg - 40deg in the JPL Mars Yard.},

To minimize the complexity of the design, the transformation process of the wheel is passive, which eliminates the need for additional actuators. A new triggering mechanism is also employed to increase the transformation success rate. To maximize the climbing ability in legged-wheel mode, the design parameters for the transformable wheel and robot are tuned based on behavioral analyses. The performance of our new development is evaluated in terms of stability, energy efficiency, and the maximum height of an obstacle that the robot can climb over. With the new transformable wheel, the robot can climb over an obstacle 3.25 times as tall as its wheel radius, without compromising its driving ability at a speed of 2.4 body lengths/s with a specific resistance of 0.7 on a flat surface.},

Dante II’s uniqueness stems from its combined legged and rappelling mobility system, its scanning-laser rangefinder, and its multilevel control scheme. In 1994 Dante II was deployed and successfully tested in a remote Alaskan volcano, as a demonstration of the fieldworthiness of these technologies. For more than five days the robot explored alone in the volcano crater using a combination of supervised autonomous control and teleoperated control. Human operators were located 120 km distant during the mission. This article first describes in detail the robot, support systems, control techniques, and user interfaces. We then describe results from the battery of field tests leading up to and including the volcanic mission. Finally, we put forth important lessons which comprise the legacy of this project. We show that framewalkers are appropriate for rappelling in severe terrain, though tether systems have limitations. We also discuss the importance of future “autonomous” systems to realize when they require human support rather than relying on humans for constant oversight. },

The MSL EDL sequence is a result of a more stringent requirement set than any of its predecessors. Notable among these requirements is landing a 900 kg rover in a landing ellipse much smaller than that of any previous Mars lander. In meeting these requirements, MSL is extending the limits of the EDL technologies qualified by the Mars viking, Mars pathfinder, and Mars exploration rover missions. Thus, there are many design challenges that must be solved for the mission to be successful. Several pieces of the EDL design are technological firsts, such as guided entry and precision landing on another planet, as well as the entire sky crane maneuver. This paper discusses the MSL EDL architecture and discusses some of the challenges faced in delivering an unprecedented rover payload to the surface of Mars.},

By contrast, the highest altitude landing to date on Mars has been the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) MER-B at 1.44 km below the areoid. The coupling of this improved altitude performance with latitude limits as large as 60 degrees off of the equator and a precise delivery to within 10 km of a surface target will allow the science community to select the MSL landing site from thousands of scientifically interesting possibilities. In meeting these requirements, MSL is extending the limits of the EDL technologies qualified by the Mars Viking, Mars Pathfinder, and MER missions. This paper discusses the MSL EDL architecture, system, and subsystem design and discusses some of the challenges faced in delivering such an unprecedented rover payload to the surface of Mars},

However, in disaster scenarios, with the communication infrastructure damaged and cluttered environment, first responders can be in disadvantage without proper communication and global information about the mission. In this sense, the use of aerial robots have a clear advantage over other kind of robots, since they are able to navigate over large areas faster and with a privileged view from above. This paper proposes a methodology for three-dimensional area coverage using multiple small UAVs based upon a customized cell decomposition algorithm using regular hexagons. The approach has been thoroughly evaluated in different simulated scenarios. We also report on the results of experiments performed with real UAVs in an outdoor environment.},

The passive wheel can be transformed into sole mode by rotating ankle roll joints when roller-walker walks on rough terrain. This paper describes adaptation of characteristics of the propulsion by a leg trajectory in the case of wheeled locomotion. Firstly, the authors demonstrate that Roller-Walker could achieve high-speed propulsion and slope climbing propulsion by simply changing parameters of the leg trajectory on the hardware experiments. Secondly, an asymptotic parameter tuning method is introduced to perform specified velocity on the different surfaces with different friction. The method is evaluated in numerical simulations. The results suggest that the method allows the Roller-Walker to have a function similar to an automatic transmission of a usual car.},

The proposed motion control approach is extremely simple computationally, does not require knowledge of the robot's dynamic model or environmental parameters, and does not necessitate late the use of external sensors.

For example, goal locations were specified daily by human operators; the rover then safely traversed to these locations. During traverses, the rover autonomously detected and avoided rock, slope, and drop-off hazards, changing its path as needed before turning back towards its goal.

NASA's Exploration Technology Development Program is investing in a broad range of surface mobility projects. Within this range of projects falls a rover vehicle, capable of moving suited crew members and cargo. A prototype, known as Chariot has been developed. This prototype vehicle is a multipurpose, reconfigurable, modular lunar surface vehicle. And, with the right attachments and/or crew accommodations, Chariot will be capable of serving a large number of functions.},

As an extremely demanding challenge typical of DARPA, the DRC required rapid research and development to push the boundaries of robotics and set a new benchmark for complex robotic behavior. We present how we addressed each of the eight tasks of the DRC and review our performance in the Finals. While the ambitious competition schedule limited extensive experimentation, we will review the data we collected during the approximately three years of our participation. We discuss some of the significant lessons learned that contributed to our success in the DRC. These include hardware lessons, software lessons, and human-robot integration lessons. We describe refinements to the coactive design methodology that helped our designers connect human–machine interaction theory to both implementation and empirical data. This approach helped our team focus our limited resources on the issues most critical to success. In addition to helping readers understand our experiences in developing on a Boston Dynamics Atlas robot for the DRC, we hope this article will provide insights that apply more widely to robotics development and design of human–machine systems.},

To imitate the Fukushima nuclear disaster situation, the DRC performed eight tasks and degraded communication conditions. This competition demanded various robotic technologies, such as manipulation, mobility, telemetry, autonomy, and localization. Their systematic integration and the overall system robustness were also important issues in completing the challenge. In this sense, this paper presents a hardware and software system for the DRC-HUBO+, a humanoid robot that was used for the DRC; it also presents control methods, such as inverse kinematics, compliance control, a walking algorithm, and a vision algorithm, all of which were implemented to accomplish the tasks. The strategies and operations for each task are briefly explained with vision algorithms. This paper summarizes what we learned from the DRC before the conclusion. In the competition, 25 international teams participated with their various robot platforms. We competed in this challenge using the DRC-HUBO+ and won first place in the competition.},

The design process, mechatronics, software infrastructure, behavioral development, and leg-wheel dynamic characteristics are described. The performance of the robot is evaluated in various scenarios, including driving and turning in wheeled mode, driving, step and bar crossing, irregular terrain passing, and stair climbing in legged mode. Taking advantage of the leg-wheel combination on a single platform, the comparison of the wheeled and legged locomotion is also discussed.},

RHex has only six actuators—one motor located at each hip— achieving mechanical simplicity that promotes reliable and robust operation in real-world tasks. Empirically stable and highly maneuverable locomotion arises from a very simple clock-driven, open-loop tripod gait. The legs rotate full circle, thereby preventing the common problem of toe stubbing in the protraction (swing) phase. An extensive suite of experimental results documents the robot’s significant “intrinsic mobility”—the traversal of rugged, broken, and obstacle-ridden ground without any terrain sensing or actively controlled adaptation. RHex achieves fast and robust forward locomotion traveling at speeds up to one body length per second and traversing height variations well exceeding its body clearance. },

  abstract  = {A number of space missions have proven the effectiveness of applying robots for planetary exploration. Those missions are usually handicapped by long distances and limited resources on the communication network which making such operations less efficient. One possible approach to overcome this problem is by increasing the level of autonomy of the deployed robotic systems. However, this is only cautiously being accepted as a tool for existing space missions and thus applied in a very limited fashion. Some reasons for these are limited experience with this technology in space missions, development costs, and a low to no risk tolerance in space missions. Meanwhile, the &#147;pressure to reduce manpower during routine mission operation&#148; [1] is real, though thus such robotic missions are far from becoming routine missions and demanding further research on novel mission design concepts. Therefore, this paper presents a novel approach for applying reconfigurable multi-robot systems to allow for more and safer autonomy in upcoming missions. [2] describes multi-robot systems for lunar sample collection in unknown environment using heterogeneous robots. However the robots are fixed and not reconfigurable, which a failure in one system might danger the overall mission. [3] presents the successful creation of a reconfigurable system, but it did not fully exploit the newly developed hardware capabilities for autonomy. This paper builds upon the experiences made in those projects and assumes a similarly capable multi-robot systems to introduce a concept for autonomous operations within safety constraints. This paper also outlines a strategy for improving an existing space control architecture relying on the Functional Reference Model (FRM) [4].},

An inference layer on top of a knowledge-based system allows to account for superadditive effects from physically combining two or more robots. We present a formulation of the domain-specific planning problem and outline our spatio-temporal planning approach. This approach combines the use of constrained-based satisfaction techniques with linear optimization to solve a multicommodity min-cost flow problem to deal with the transportation of immobile robotic systems. The paper describes the findings after implementing core features and evaluates the approach based on a fictitious scientific mission. We close with a discussion of the current limitations of the illustrated approach.},

To mitigate this limitation on self-healing, this paper presents a new SINGO connector that can establish or disengage a connection even if one end of the connection is not operational. We describe the design and the prototype of the connector and demonstrate its performance by both theoretical analysis and physical experimentations.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents the design of the robot AILA, a mobile dual-arm robot system developed as a research platform for investigating aspects of the currently booming multidisciplinary area of mobile manipulation. The robot integrates and allows in a single platform to perform research in most of the areas involved in autonomous robotics: navigation, mobile and dual-arm manipulation planning, active compliance and force control strategies, object recognition, scene representation, and semantic perception. AILA has 32 degrees of freedom, including 7-DOF arms, 4-DOF torso, 2-DOF head, and a mobile base equipped with six wheels, each of them with two degrees of freedom. The primary design goal was to achieve a lightweight arm construction with a payload-to-weight ratio greater than one. Besides, an adjustable body should sustain the dual-arm system providing an extended workspace. In addition, mobility is provided by means of a wheel-based mobile base. As a result, AILA's arms can lift 8kg and weigh 5.5kg, thus achieving a payload-to-weight ratio of 1.45. The paper will provide an overview of the design, especially in the mechatronics area, as well as of its realization, the sensors incorporated in the system, and its control software.},

  abstract = { Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the locomotion performance of all‐terrain rovers employing rocker‐type suspension system.Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, a robot with advanced mobility features is presented and its locomotion performance is evaluated, following an analytical approach via extensive simulations. The vehicle features an independently controlled four‐wheel‐drive/4‐wheel‐steer architecture and it also employs a passive rocker‐type suspension system that improves the ability to traverse uneven terrain. An overview of modeling techniques for rover‐like vehicles is introduced. First, a method for formulating a kinematic model of an articulated vehicle is presented. Next, a method for expressing a quasi‐static model of forces acting on the robot is described. A modified rocker‐type suspension is also proposed that enables wheel camber change, allowing each wheel to keep an upright posture as the suspension conforms to ground unevenness.Findings – The proposed models can be used to assess the locomotion performance of a mobile robot on rough‐terrain for design, control and path planning purposes. The advantage of the rocker‐type suspension over conventional spring‐type counterparts is demonstrated. The variable camber suspension is shown to be effective in improving a robot's traction and climbing ability.Research limitations/implications – The paper can be of great value when studying and optimizing the locomotion performance of mobile robots on rough terrain. These models can be used as a basis for advanced design, control and motion planning.Originality/value – The paper describes an analytical approach for the study of the mobility characteristics of vehicles endowed with articulated suspension systems. A variable camber mechanism is also presented. },
