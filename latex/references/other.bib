    abstract = {The accurate determination of the Mars pole vector derived from Pathfinder and Viking Lander radio data (Folkner et al., 1997), together with the VSOP87 representation of planetary orbits (Bretagnon and Francou, 1988), have been applied to a new evaluation of the right ascension of the "fictitious mean sun" (FMS) at Mars. With ΔtJ2000 the elapsed time in days from the J2000 epoch (J.D.2451545.0TT), αFMS = 270°.3863 + 0.52403840(°/d)ΔtJ2000 - 4×10-13 (°/d2)Δt2J2000 represents a best least-squares quadratic fit of the FMS, including aberration, to each instance of the four equinox and solstice passages for each of 134 Mars orbits spanning the calendar years 1874-2127. The implied tropical orbit period for Mars, 686.9726d, closely agrees with the recent evaluations by Suran (1997) and Allison (1997). Together with the Pathfinder radio determination of the Mars sidereal rotation, the derived FMS rate corresponds to a mean solar day (or "sol") of 1.027491251d. The new FMS determination would serve to define the Mean Solar Time at Mars to the nearest tenth-second, according to historical conventions originally established for terrestrial time keeping, once the Mars prime meridian defined by the crater Airy-0 is determined within inertial space to the same accuracy. For convenient reference to current epochs, 2000 Jan 06 00:00 UTC (= MJD 51549.000UTC) corresponds to a coincidence of αFMS and the rotation angle of the crater Airy-0 measured with respect to the Mars equinox (i.e. "mean solar midnight" on the planet's prime meridian), to within the current uncertainty of several seconds in the locational definition of the planet's cartographic grid. As a further result of the analysis, the consistently derived Mars obliquity of date is ε = 25°.192 + 3.45×10-7(°/d)ΔtJ2000. An improved analytic recipe for the calculation of the solar areocentric longitude (Ls) of Mars to an accuracy of 0°.01 is also provided, accounting for the primary perturbations of Earth, Jupiter, and Venus, which may in turn be applied to an efficient evaluation of Mars local true solar time (LTST) to within the uncertainty of the inertial position of the Mars prime meridian. For specific applications to the data archives for landed Mars spacecraft, simple conversion formulae are given for the determination of the Viking "Local Lander Time" and the Pathfinder "Local True Solar Time" in terms of the terrestrial calendar date and UTC.},

    journal = {The Mars Journal},
    doi = {10.1555/mars.2007.0001},
    abstract = {Future exploratory drilling on Mars will ideally employ drill bits that are capable of penetrating any terrain from hard rocks such as basalt to ice or ice-bound soils. Candidate drill bits include diamond impregnated or surface-set types, and bits with large individual cutters, typically made of polycrystalline diamond or tungsten carbide composites. Each has disadvantages, but bits with large individual cutters seem more likely to be capable of improvement. Drilling in hard rocks poses difficulties for these bits, so we have investigated their performance in basalt. Basalt rock was chosen as it is the most prevalent type of rock found on the surface of Mars, and any future drilling mission to Mars will probably encounter basalt while drilling a hole (even if drilling basalt was not the mission objective). It is also one of the hardest types of rock, which makes the design of a Mars drilling system very challenging, especially because a lander or a rover will be constrained to low mass and limited power. Method: Custom designed core bits with discrete cutters (Polycrystalline Diamond or PDC elements) were used to drill high strength basalt rock under conditions of low temperature and pressure appropriate to Mars. The experimental arrangement allowed for remote control of the weight-on-bit and the rotational speed of the drill string. Acquired data included weight-on-bit, rotational speed of the drill, reaction torque, drilling power, penetration rate, bit temperature and the temperature of the drilled formation. Conclusion: Penetration in the basalt was initially rapid, but increasing wear required progressive increases in the applied weight-on-bit to maintain the rate of penetration. Eventually, the wear was so great that penetration could not be maintained with 500 N, the maximum weight that can reasonably be expected on a small exploration vehicle (~150-200 kg). In the present case, for a core bit with an outside diameter of 38 mm and an inside diameter of 25 mm, the wear limit was reached after a depth of five centimeters had been penetrated. Additional penetration to a depth of over 15 cm was possible only after increasing the Weight on Bit to 950 N. The drilling power was in the range of 100 W. Improvements in drilling performance could potentially be achieved by reducing the bit diameter, changing the bit design and replacing a PDC cutter with a more wear resistant material. The bit performance has also been modeled, and a consistent explanation for the bit behavior was found.}

    abstract = {NASA launched two rovers in June and July of 2003 as a part of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project. MERA (Spirit) landed on Mars in Gusev Crater at 15 degrees South latitude and 175 degrees East longitude on January 4, 2004 (Squyres, et al., Dec. 2004). MER-B (Opportunity) landed on Mars in Terra Meridiani at 2 degrees South latitude and 354 degrees East longitude on January 25, 2004 (Squyres, et al., Aug. 2004). Both rovers have well exceeded their design lifetime (90 Sols) by more than a factor of 5. Spirit and Opportunity are still healthy and continue to execute their roving science missions at the time of this writing. This paper discusses rover flight thermal performance during the surface missions of both vehicles, covering roughly the time from the MER- landing in late Southern Summer (aereocentric longitude, Ls = 328, Sol 1A) through the Southern Winter solstice (Ls = 90, Sol 255A) to nearly Southern Vernal equinox (Ls = 160 , Sol 398A). This paper describes the MER rover thermal design, its implementation and performance on Mars. The rover surface thermal design performance was better than prelanding predictions. The very successful thermal design allowed a high level of communications immediately after landing without overheating and required a minimal amount of survival heating in the dead of winter. An analytical thermal model developed for the rover was used to predict surface operations performance. A reduced-node version of this model was integrated into the mission planning tool to achieve the proper balance between: 1) a desired science and communications operating profile, 2) the energy available from the power system and 3) requirements to maintain rover hardware within prescribed temperature limits. One of the more challenging thermal problems during surface operations, predicting the performance of actuator and camera electronics warmup heaters, was automated by using heater lookup tables that were periodically updated based on flight telemetry. Specific MER rover thermal flight experiences are discussed in this paper. Lessons learned and suggestions for improving future Mars surface vehicle designs are presented.},

These fans suggest long-term fluvial activity accompanied by a lake inside the basin. The elevational difference between the delta plains and the deepest part of the basin floor implies that this lake was 600m deep. Iron–magnesium phyllosilicates, which are mapped from near-infrared spectral data, are associated with layered sediments >300m thick at the base of one of the fans. Stratigraphic relationships with the surrounding plateau show that the valleys are hesperian in age (3.0–3.7ga), thus dating the lake activity to this period. The coexistence of a deep lake and phyllosilicates demonstrates that persistent bodies of liquid water were present during the hesperian period."

These regions correspond with light-toned sulfate-rich deposits identified by the European Space Agency's OMEGA visible/near-IR spectrometer. Much of the light-toned material in Aureum and Iani Chaos is in the form of a capping unit similar to that seen in Aram Chaos. However, some light-toned material is also seen within the chaotic mounds, indicating that it was present before the formation of the chaotic terrains. The stratigraphy of the units in Iani and Aureum Chaos suggests that the capping and hematite-rich units must have been deposited after the formation of the chaotic terrains in the mid to late Hesperian, up to 1 Gyr after the formation of the light-toned outcrop in Meridiani Planum. The geologic contexts of these and other hematite- and sulfate-rich units in Aram Chaos, Valles Marineris, and Meridiani Planum indicate that they likely formed in similar environments under aqueous conditions. If this is the case, it suggests an active hydrological cycle lasting from the late Noachian to the late Hesperian.},

    abstract = {The origin mechanisms and geologic evolution of chaotic terrain on Mars are poorly constrained. Iani Chaos, located at the head Ares Vallis, is among the most geomorphologically complex of the chaotic terrains. Its morphology is defined by (1) multiple, 1 to 2 km deep basins, (2) flat-topped, fractured plateaus that are remnants of highland terrain, (3) knobby, fractured remnants of highland terrain, (4) plateaus with a knobby surface morphology, (5) interchaos grooved terrain, (6) interior layered deposits (ILDs), and (7) mantling material. Topography, the observed geomorphology, and measured fracture patterns suggest that the interchaos basins formed as a result of subsurface volume loss and collapse of the crust, likely owing to effusion of groundwater to the surface. Regional patterns in fracture orientation indicate that the basins developed along linear zones of preexisting weakness in the highland crust. Multiple overlapping basins and fracture systems point to multiple stages of collapse at Iani Chaos. Furthermore, the total estimated volume loss from the basins (104 km3) is insufficient to explain erosion of 104–105 km3 of material from Ares Vallis by a single flood. Comparisons with the chronology of Ares Vallis indicate multiple water effusion events from Iani Chaos that span the Hesperian, with termination of activity in the early Amazonian. Recharge of groundwater through preexisting fracture systems may explain this long-lived, but likely episodic, fluvial activity. Late-stage, early to middle Amazonian aqueous processes may have deposited the ILDs. However, the topography data indicate that the ILDs did not form within lacustrine environments.},
