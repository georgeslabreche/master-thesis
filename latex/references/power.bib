  title = {Mars Solar Power},
  abstract = {NASA missions to Mars, both robotic and human, rely on solar arrays for the primary power system. Mars presents a number of challenges for solar power system operation, including a dusty atmosphere which modifies the spectrum and intensity of the incident solar illumination as a function of time of day, degradation of the array performance by dust deposition, and low temperature operation. The environmental challenges to Mars solar array operation will be discussed and test results of solar cell technology operating under Mars conditions will be presented, along with modeling of solar cell performance under Mars conditions. The design implications for advanced solar arrays for future Mars missions is discussed, and an example case, a Martian polar rover, are analyzed.},

  abstract={The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) program posed a significant engineering and technology challenge. Now that the Rovers have operated beyond their original design life of three months by nearly a factor of four it is clear that the challenge was met and far exceeded. A key to the success of MER has been the enhanced power provided by the cruise and Rover solar arrays. Benefiting from a nearly 50% improvement in cell efficiency compared to the single junction GaAs cells used on Pathfinder, the MER designs were subject to many constraints both in design and in operation. These constraints included limited available panel area, changing illumination levels and temperatures, and variable shadowing, atmospheric conditions and dust accumulation for the rovers. This paper will discuss those constraints and their impact on the design. In addition, flight data will be provided to assess the performance achieved during the mission.},

  abstract={Solar cells operating on the surface of Mars receive a spectrum of illumination different from the AM0 spectrum, since the sunlight is filtered by dust suspended in the atmosphere. This spectrum changes with the amount of dust in the atmosphere, as well as with air mass change due to time of day and season. This spectral variation affects the performance of solar cells. We used data from Mars Exploration Rovers to measure this spectrum. By comparing the measured intensity with the known reflectance of the pancam calibration target on the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, we measure the solar spectrum reaching the surface. The effect of this spectrum on the performance of solar cells is then calculated based on the spectral response of several different solar cell types},

Multiple approaches have been suggested for significantly surpassing the 30% efficiency level, but achieving this in a commercially viable cell has not been easy. We review those approaches, pointing out the advantages and challenges of each. SolAero has been focused on developing the inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) solar cell, and has recently demonstrated a radiation hard version. We present the most recent performance data, including the response to particle radiation. The IMM cell can be used in a number of rigid or flexible configurations, and considerable effort has been focused on cell packaging and panel integration. The IMM device is ready to start qualification to the ECSS and AIAA standards.},

In this study we took into consideration the concentration effect of alloys x (In) and y (N) on the strain, the bandgap, the absorption and structure efficiency. It has been shown that the concentration of indium varies the strain and the bandgap. These two parameters change considerably the yield. Also it optimized the effect of alloys on the total absorption of the structure. For a concentration of indium x = 0.40 and y = 0.03 we had a absorption coefficient which is equal to 2 × 106 cm−1. We have found 50% efficiency for the multi-junction structure based on In0.55Ga0.45P/In0.40Ga0.60As/In0.30Ga0.70As0.97N0.03/Ge. To achieve a reliable high efficiency multi-junction structure, we just need to optimize the concentrations of different alloys."
