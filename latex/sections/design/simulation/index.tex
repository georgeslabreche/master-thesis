The proposed rover and \ac{SA} configurations for both mission sites are modeled with Blender/Phobos and loaded into MARS for mission scenario simulation. Phobos is ``an add-on for the open-source 3D modeling software Blender that enables the creation of robot models for use in robot frameworks like ROS and ROCK or in real-time simulations such as MARS'' \citeother{Phobos}. MARS is ``a cross-platform simulation and visualisation tool created for robotics research. It consists of a core framework containing all main simulation components, a GUI (based on Qt), 3D visualization (using OSG) and a physics engine (based on ODE)'' \citeother{MARSSim}. \refFig{fig:simulated-mission-site-ismenius-cavus} shows the robot model loaded on the MARS platform to simulate mission scenarios using a \ac{HiRISE} \ac{DTM} of a well preserved crater at Ismenius Cavus. The simulated solar power output data is produced by a \ac{PMS} implemented as part of this thesis and is integrated with the robot simulation toolkit.

\subsection{Z-Axis Revolutions}

\refFig{fig:sub:simulation-data-rover-revolution-generated-power-line-chart} and \refFig{fig:sub:simulation-data-rover-revolution-generated-power-polar-chart} are two different representations of the same solar power output obtained from commanding the rover to execute a \SI{10}{\degree} forward body-pitch followed by several revolutions around its z-axis. These revolutions result in a sinusoidal power output variation. Local spikes and dips are noted during the 480-\SI{600}{\second} and 840-\SI{960}{\second} time frames when the solar arrays are directed northwards. These are caused by the rover driving over uneven terrain which affect the \ac{SA} inclination and orientation. In \refFig{fig:sub:simulation-data-rover-revolution-generated-power-polar-chart}, the angle values represent the direction faced by the inclined \ac{SA}. Maximum power is generated when the \ac{SA} is oriented soutwards, towards the equator, in the general direction of the Sun. Inversely, facing northwards, away from the sun, generates the least amount of power.

\subsection{Slope Compensation}

The slope compensation scenario illustrated in \refFig{fig:sub:rover-on-slope-beta-small} is simulated in \refFig{fig:sub:rover-slope-compensation-simulation} where the rover's body is pitched bakwards by \SI{10}{\degree} while on a \SI{30}{\degree} forward inclined slope. The slope's inclination is facing away from the Sun, resulting in a worst case power output.

\refFig{fig:sub:rover-slope-compensation-power-profile} shows solar power outputs for different body-pitch configuration while the rover is on a \SI{30}{\degree} slope. The initial state of the \ac{SA} $\beta$ inclination angle is equal to that of the slope angle. Two seperate \SI{5}{\degree} forward pitch increments are executed at \SI{25}{\second} and \SI{35}{\second} which worsen solar power output by changing \ac{SA} $\beta$ inclination angle from ~\SI{30}{\degree} to ~\SI{40}{\degree}. Following that, four separate \SI{5}{\degree} backward pitch decrements are executed from \SI{45}{\second} to \SI{65}{\second}, progressively improving power generation as $\beta$ is changed from ~\SI{40}{\degree} to ~\SI{20}{\degree}. As a final task, the rover is commanded to drive forward at \SI{80}{\second} and it encounters uneven terrain which introduces minor fluctuations to the solar power output.
