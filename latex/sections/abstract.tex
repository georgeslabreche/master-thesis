The SherpaTT rover is prepared for further autonomous long distance traverses in terrain akin to the Martian environment. However, it features a fueled power generator which cannot be employed in extra-terrestial scenarios. As the rover is meant to approach a higher technology readiness level, a photovoltaic power subsystem is proposed to guide future design iterations. This thesis presents the solar array sizing, design, and integration processes considered for two Martian mission sites: Iani Chaos at \SI{2}{\degree}S and Ismenius Cavus at \SI{34}{\degree}N. An alternative use case for the active suspension system is presented so that the proposed solar arrays may be inclined and oriented into power generating configuration that are more favourable as those achieved with passive suspension rovers. This results in traverse gains of up to \SI{34}{\percent} and \SI{25}{\percent} for clear days at Iani Chaos and Ismenius Cavus, respectively.
