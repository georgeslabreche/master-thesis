This chapter briefly explores the state of art in space grade solar and battery cell technologies. \refSec{sec:StateOfTheArt:PastAndOngoingMissions} presents an overview of past and ongoing missions. The state of practice is briefly touched upon in \refSec{sec:StateOfTheArt:PlannedMissions} as a segue to the state of the art in \refSec{sec:StateOfTheArt:PhotovoltaicsAndEnergyStorage}.

\section{Summary and Conclusion}
\label{sec:StateOfTheArt:SummaryAndConclusion}
Solar and battery cells are reviewed for past, ongoing, and planned Mars surface missions in order to appreciate technological limitations. From this analysis the \ac{IMM} solar cell is selected thus introducing an \ac{EOL} efficiency of \SI{22.5}{\percent} that must be considered during \ac{SA} sizing.
