%\todo[inline]{JOSE: The first part of the conclusion explained me much more than the abstract of the thesis of what i would be expecting. maybe you can re-use some of the conclusion as abstract/intro. The abstractd/intro are currently a bit confusing mixing the 20 systems you developed , the EMI, hybrid locomotion usw. Reading this following paragraph at the very beginning would have helped me:\newline\newline In this thesis, the \electromech design, implementation, locomotion control and experimental validation of a novel type of hybrid wheeled-leg exploration rover are presented. The actively articulated suspension system of the rover is the the basis for advanced locomotive capabilities of a mobile exploration robot.
%The developed locomotion control system abstracts the complex kinematics of the suspension
%system and provides platform control inputs usable by autonomous behaviors or human remote
%control.
%The rover is part of a multi-robot exploration system with an aspired sample return mission to the lunar south pole or currently hard-to-access regions on Mars. The multi-robot system pursues a modular and reconfigurable design methodology and combines heterogeneous robots
%with different locomotion capabilities for enhanced overall performance}

%\todo[inline]{JOSE: you are more concise talking about one rover in general. of course, later you mention all the developments as they are, but maybe start a bit more generic and to the point.}
