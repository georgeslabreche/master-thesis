  abstract={Solar cells operating on the surface of Mars receive a spectrum of illumination different from the AM0 spectrum, since the sunlight is filtered by dust suspended in the atmosphere. This spectrum changes with the amount of dust in the atmosphere, as well as with air mass change due to time of day and season. This spectral variation affects the performance of solar cells. We used data from Mars Exploration Rovers to measure this spectrum. By comparing the measured intensity with the known reflectance of the pancam calibration target on the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, we measure the solar spectrum reaching the surface. The effect of this spectrum on the performance of solar cells is then calculated based on the spectral response of several different solar cell types},
