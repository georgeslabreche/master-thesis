  abstract = "Dust aerosol plays a fundamental role in the behavior and evolution of the martian atmosphere. The first five Mars years of Mars Exploration Rover data provide an unprecedented record of the dust load at two sites. This record is useful for characterization of the atmosphere at the sites and as ground truth for orbital observations. Atmospheric extinction optical depths have been derived from solar images after calibration and correction for time-varying dust that has accumulated on the camera windows. The record includes local, regional, and globally extensive dust storms. Comparison with contemporaneous thermal infrared data suggests significant variation in the size of the dust aerosols, with a 1μm effective radius during northern summer and a 2μm effective radius at the onset of a dust lifting event. The solar longitude (LS) 20–136° period is also characterized by the presence of cirriform clouds at the Opportunity site, especially near LS=50° and 115°. In addition to water ice clouds, a water ice haze may also be present, and carbon dioxide clouds may be present early in the season. Variations in dust opacity are important to the energy balance of each site, and work with seasonal variations in insolation to control dust devil frequency at the Spirit site."

  abstract = {We employ the NASA Ames Mars general circulation model (GCM) to investigate the dust lifting mechanisms responsible for the observed Martian dust cycle and the net surface response to the combined influence of dust lifting and deposition. This GCM includes lifting, transport, and deposition of radiatively active dust. Two dust lifting mechanisms are accounted for: wind stress lifting and dust devil lifting. A “baseline” simulation is presented and shown to compare well to available spatial and temporal observations of atmospheric opacity, wind stress dust lifting events, and atmospheric temperatures recorded during a nonglobal dust storm year. Multiple simulations were conducted to explore the model's sensitivity to a wide range of dust lifting parameters (the functional dependence of surface dust flux on wind stress, the wind stress threshold for lifting, etc.) Model results robustly suggest that wind stress lifting produces the peak in atmospheric dust load during southern spring and summer and that dust devils maintain the background haze of atmospheric dust during northern spring and summer. These results are consistent with previously published conclusions. Dust devil and wind stress lifting contribute equally to the simulated total amount of dust lifted annually during nonglobal dust storm years. The simulated spatial pattern of annual net deflation/deposition suggests that the low thermal inertia regions (Tharsis, Arabia, and Elysium) are not currently net dust accumulation regions. This net deflation is the result of dust devil dust lifting, suggesting that dust devils could play an important role in the present-day pattern of surface dust reservoirs.},
