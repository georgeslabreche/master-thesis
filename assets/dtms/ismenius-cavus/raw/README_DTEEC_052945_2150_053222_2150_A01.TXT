Products are tied to MOLA elevations.
Elevation range for this project:
  VALID_MINIMUM    = -2011.13 m
  VALID_MAXIMUM    = -1754.39 m

SOCET SET NGATE was used to extract terrain.

Post spacing in DTM is 1 m.

NOTE: Total RMS ==> 0.22858 px RMS x ==> 0.7423 m RMS y ==> 0.29855 m RMS z
==> 3.2676 m Total RMS ==> 3.2943 m Mean difference from MOLA is 0.057
m and the Std Dev is 3.671 m.

		ORTHO indicates that the image has been orthorectified

Figure of Merit (FOM) Map
  The FOM Map (DTF...JP2) shows stereo correlation quality for each pixel 
  (elevation post) in the DTM. The quality categories are identifed in
  the legend file FOM_MAP_LEGEND.JPG. 
  
  Figure of merit (FOM) values are 
  automatically collected by SOCET SET 5.x as part of the stereo 
  correlation for the output DTM. These values are then simplified 
  into a more generically defined value based on the Lunar Mapping and 
  Modeling Project (LMMP) Confidence Map categories.

  relief map.

KNOWN ARTIFACTS
 These are known artifacts present in some, but not all, HiRISE DTMs.
 They may not be present in this DTM! Look at the terrain shaded relief 
 to detect these before using the DTM!
 - Boxes
	Some DTMs have square areas that are usually about .5-1 m different 
	in elevation from the surrounding areas. These are artifacts of the 
	processing algorithms used in Socet Set ((c) BAE Systems). There may 
	be goups of these boxes. They are almost impossible to edit, so the 
	user should look for such artifacts in a terrain shaded relief map 
	before using the DTM for analysis.
 - CCD seams
	A HiRISE image is made up of 10 individual images, stitched together 
	along their long edges.	In a DTM, these seams can be visible as long 
	lines. These seams are difficult to remove.
 - Faceted areas
 	Areas that were very bland (low contrast) or deeply shadowed with 
 	low contrast and low signal may have a "faceted" look to them. 
 	Terrain in these areas is not trustworthy.
